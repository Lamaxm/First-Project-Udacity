Image Processing API

In this project I created a tool that resizes the image to give it the required height and width and the name of the image and it says change the size

At first it will check if the output folder exists, if not, it will create it
If there is, it will see if the sound has been processed with the same measurements before or not
If the same measurements are processed, the program will stop, and if it does not, it will see the height and width, change the image measurements, and send a message that the operation is successful.
